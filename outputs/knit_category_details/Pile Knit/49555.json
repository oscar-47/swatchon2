    "Finish": "Mechanical > Brushed (back) Brushed is a finishing process that gently raises the surface fibers of the fabric using brushes. This treatment causes the fibers to stand up, creating a soft texture. As a result, the fabric surface becomes fuzzy, providing a warm and soft feel. The brushed surface traps air to reduce heat loss, making it ideal for fall and winter.",
    "Dye Method": "Cation Dye Cation-dyed fabrics feature a unique heather effect that varies based on the ratio of cation-dyeable polyester fibers. When applied to cotton blends, the dye only colors the surface, resulting in a natural fading and vintage appearance. Due to this process, color variations may occur between production lots, and the yardage may differ slightly from the provided swatches.",
    "Care Advice": "Knit When you receive a knit product, it may be stiff and wrinkled. This is because the fabric has been folded and compressed for shipping. To soften and straighten the fabric, you should condition it for 2-3 days at room temperature before using it.",

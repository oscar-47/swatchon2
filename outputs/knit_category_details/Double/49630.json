This treatment causes the fibers to stand up, creating a soft texture. As a result, the fabric surface becomes fuzzy, providing a warm and soft feel. The brushed surface traps air to reduce heat loss, making it ideal for fall and winter. Chemical > Enzyme Enzymes treatment offers a remarkably soft hand-feel by gently breaking down the fibers’ surface, resulting in a smoother and cleaner texture. This treatment also reduces pilling and fuzz, enhancing the fabric’s durability and maintaining a clean appearance",

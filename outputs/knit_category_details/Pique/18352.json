When a winter outer layer is combined with a warm lining, it enhances insulation while also supporting a structured, defined silhouette. Chemical > Wicking Wicking is a textile treatment that enables fabric to draw moisture or sweat away from the skin and help it evaporate quickly. This keeps the wearer cool and fresh.",
    "Dye Method": "Cation Dye Cation-dyed fabrics feature a unique heather effect that varies based on the ratio of cation-dyeable polyester fibers. When applied to cotton blends, the dye only colors the surface, resulting in a natural fading and vintage appearance. Due to this process, color variations may occur between production lots, and the yardage may differ slightly from the provided swatches.",

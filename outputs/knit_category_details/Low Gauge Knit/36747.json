This treatment causes the fibers to stand up, creating a soft texture. As a result, the fabric surface becomes fuzzy, providing a warm and soft feel. The brushed surface traps air to reduce heat loss, making it ideal for fall and winter. Chemical > Milled Milling(felting) is the process of beating wet, woven woolen cloth to cause the opposing fibers to interlock and form a more homogeneous textile. It results in a denser fabric with slight water and wind resistance.",

When a winter outer layer is combined with a warm lining, it enhances insulation while also supporting a structured, defined silhouette. Mechanical > Brushed (back) Brushed is a finishing process that gently raises the surface fibers of the fabric using brushes. This treatment causes the fibers to stand up, creating a soft texture. As a result, the fabric surface becomes fuzzy, providing a warm and soft feel. The brushed surface traps air to reduce heat loss, making it ideal for fall and winter.",

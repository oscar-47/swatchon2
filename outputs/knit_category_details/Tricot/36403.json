Quick Dry Quick dry is a technical fabric that wicks away sweat and moisture, helping to maintain a cool and fresh feeling. Stain Resistant Stain resistance works by preventing liquids from being absorbed and fine particles from adhering to the fabric. This can be done either by using fibers that naturally resist stains, or by adding a special coating that helps keep stains from sticking.

This treatment helps protect the wearer or the item from rain and moisture, making it suitable for outerwear, bags, and outdoor gear. 4 Way Stretch A 4-way stretch fabric stretches and recovers both width and lengthwise, allowing it to move naturally with the body and return to its original shape.

The chemicals dissolve or “burn out” one type of fiber, removing it from the fabric. This creates a semi-transparent pattern or texture as the remaining fibers stand out. Burnout finish adds a unique, decorative effect with a mix of sheer and solid areas. However, due to the nature of the chemical process, slight variations in the pattern may occur between batches.

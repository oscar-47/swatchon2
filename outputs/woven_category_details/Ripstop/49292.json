Through washing processes, it induces slight shrinkage and creates natural creases and streaks, adding a vintage-like appearance and texture to the fabric. Chemical > PU Coated (front) PU coated refers to a thin layer of polyurethane applied to the fabricâ€™s front side. This coating provides water resistance, enhances durability, creates a smooth surface texture, and offers some resistance to stains and wind.

This enhances resistance to light rain and splashes, helping garments stay drier and more comfortable without compromising breathability.",
